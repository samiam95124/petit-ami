To do list for Petit-ami

1. Add floating point conversions to stdio.

2. Enable floating point speed calculations based on #1.

3. Implement joysticks and test with multiple joysticks.

4. Set sizing from ANSI cursor readback method.

5. Implement read of rc file from each of program, user and current location.

6. Finish sample programs.

7. event.c shows the cursor being turned off without being commanded by the source.

8. getc() does not work. We got scntst.c to work by using fgetc(). It is because getc() is a macro.

9. snake.c does not keep score.

10. Should save and restore base screen to buffer 0.

11. Implement function keys.

12. in Snake game, the snakel[] array uses 1 based indexing. This would cause
overflow.

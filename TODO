To do list for Petit-ami

1. Add floating point conversions to stdio.

2. Enable floating point speed calculations based on #1.

3. Find a method to implement the mouse. Because this has to be carefully coordinated
with the onscreen cursor, this may be better left to the ncurses version.

4. Implement joysticks and test with multiple joysticks.

5. Set sizing from ANSI cursor readback method.

6. Implement tearoff command line parameters.

7. Implement read of rc file from each of program, user and current location.

8. Implement resize messaging.

9. Finish sample programs.

10. event.c shows the cursor being turned off without being commanded by the source.

11. getc() does not work. We got scntst.c to work by using fgetc(). It is because getc() is a macro.

12. snake.c does not keep score.

13. In snake.c, should not be able to back over and kill yourself.

14. Should save and restore base screen to buffer 0.

Notes for graph.c

1. When a program finishes, and is in autohold, it cannot be cancelled with
ctl-c. I studied the issue, and apparently by the time it function pa_deinit_graph
function is executed, something has occurred to damage the input queue such that
characters typed to the input queue are not serviced, and thus the window locks
as unresponsive. This was proved by moving the hold code into a function "softshutdown()"
then call that from main program, and it works fine.

2. Should have option to send windows/general errors to a dialog.

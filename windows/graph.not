Notes for graph.c

1. When a program finishes, and is in autohold, it cannot be cancelled with
ctl-c.

2. If a program does not exit, and ctl-c is hit in main/text window, the window
disappears, but the program goes zombie.

3. Errors in graph print in main window, but then it wedges.

4. Should have option to send windows/general errors to a dialog.

5. Need to hook up graph with the option processor.

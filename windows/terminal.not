Windows console notes

1. Its slow. Need to study why the character write speed is an order of
magnitude slower than before.

2. Does not listen to ctl-c when very busy.

3. Need to pick up cursor location from windows again, at the start. Otherwise
the typing is not attached to the existing insert point.

4. Does odd things when the buffer is very much greater than the screen size.

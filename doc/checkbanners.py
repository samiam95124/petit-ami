"""Check the chapter banners of doc/ami.odt against the three rules they follow.

Every chapter opens with a banner: the blue box carrying the chapter number,
its title, and the cat. The rules are

  1. every chapter has one,
  2. the title keeps clear of the cat, which sits inside the box, and
  3. the chapter starts on an odd page, so it opens on a right hand leaf.

Rules 1 and 3 hold by themselves as long as the heading carries the Chapter
Banner style: that style names the ChapterStart page, whose layout is right
only, so LibreOffice breaks to the next odd page and inserts a blank leaf when
it has to. Rule 2 holds because the cat's frame wraps text to its left. The
point of this program is to prove all three of a rendered book rather than
trust them.

There is a fourth thing to prove, about the PDF rather than the document. The
blank leaf that puts a chapter on a right hand page is one LibreOffice inserts
for itself, and its PDF export leaves such leaves out unless told otherwise:
the page numbers then run 55, 57, and a book printed two sided from that file
has chapter 4 on the back of page 55 after all. The export here keeps them
(IsSkipEmptyPages off; in the export dialog, "Export automatically inserted
blank pages"), and a PDF handed in is checked for numbers that skip by two,
which is the mark of a leaf dropped on the way out.

Usage:

    python3 doc/checkbanners.py [doc/ami.pdf]

With no argument the book is rendered from doc/ami.odt into a temporary
directory first, which wants soffice. Exits nonzero if any rule is broken.

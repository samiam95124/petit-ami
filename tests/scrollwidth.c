/*******************************************************************************

A scroll bar on a child window is built as wide as the window

Open a framed window under windowc and put a vertical scroll bar one
column wide against its right edge, the way a reader pane does. The bar
is never seen: the widget's face is created at the full width of its
owner rather than the width asked for, so the bar's drawing lands in a
buffer of which one column shows -- and that column is empty.

The program draws a ruler of dots in every client row up to the column
the bar should start at, so what the right edge holds is plain: it
should be the bar's arrow, thumb and well characters, and it is blanks.

The same request against the root window draws correctly, which is how
this hid inside a mail program for a while: the message list's bar (on
the root) was fine while the reader's bar (on a child window) vanished,
and the child window was blamed.

Build as a character program against the manager:

    gcc $(CFLAGS) tests/scrollwidth.c $(CLIBSC) -o bin/scrollwidth

Run it in a terminal. Expected: a bar column on the window's right
edge, thumb at about half way. Observed: nothing.

The width the manager records for the widget can be seen by
instrumenting wigdrw: asked for x1 98, x2 98 in a client 98 wide, it
reports the face at 98 by 26 -- the width of the owner, not of the
rectangle given.

This directory is the run sandbox for the terminal test under bin/regress.
terminal_test runs here, in an xterm on a private X server, where the
configuration file turns the joysticks off so that the standard is of no
machine in particular, and where the file the writethrough test makes lands
out of the way. The lib symlink lets the test binary find the Petit-Ami
shared libraries, which are loaded relative to the current directory.

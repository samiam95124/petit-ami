                                       Terminal test notes
                                       
1. In writethrough test, see why getc() does not work. This should be done on
Windows or Mac version, since I believe it was a problem with stdio.c.

2. In scroll right and left, does not fill the last line.

3. Still problems with the threading test. Try rolling over it with the mouse, 
that seems to make it happen.

4. Need test for event functions.

/*******************************************************************************

The window and widget objects, demonstrated

This is the flaw demonstration turned right side up. Two windows, each
with a button, and the buttons may even share an id: every event is
routed by the window id in its record to the window object that holds
that window, so each override below fires for its own window's events
and no other. The question the old graph object could not answer --
"which window?" -- is answered by being asked: the object called is
the window meant.

Three tiers are shown:

    1. A widget object's virtual: the second window's button is a
       subclassed button whose pressed() fires directly.

    2. A window object's virtual: the first window's button is made
       with the plain button class and left unhandled by it, so it
       arrives at the window's evbutton(id).

    3. The procedural loop: events neither claims -- the terminate
       event here -- fall through the chain and arrive at event() in
       main, as ever.

Run under a window system; the driver script clicks both buttons and
the etterm path ends it. Every line printed says which tier caught
what, and the two ids printed may be equal: the windows tell them
apart, not the ids.

Build:

    make winobj

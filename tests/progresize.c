/*******************************************************************************

A progress bar set to a position outside its range stops the window
reporting resize -- for good

Open a sizable window, put a progress bar in it, and set the bar to a
position outside the range it takes. From that moment the window never
reports another ami_etresize: the window manager resizes it, the picture
is clipped to what it was, and nothing arrives. Everything else about
the window goes on working -- it draws, it reports redraw, it answers
the mouse -- so the program looks like one that has decided to ignore
being resized.

A position is a fraction of the whole range of a long, so LONG_MAX is
full and 0 is empty. LONG_MIN is not a position, and a program can
arrive at one easily: (double)pos/max*(double)LONG_MAX comes to exactly
2^63 when pos reaches max, which is one more than a long holds, and
converting it is undefined -- on this machine it is LONG_MIN. That is
how this was found.

Out of range is out of range, and the library is entitled to refuse it.
What it should not do is take the window's resize reporting away and
never give it back, silently, so that the fault shows up somewhere else
entirely.

    progresize bar follow move        positions all within range
    progresize bar follow move over   one position is LONG_MIN

Each resize seen is printed. The first prints three, the second none --
not even the resize that arrives before the bad position is ever set.

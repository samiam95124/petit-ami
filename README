********************************* PETIT AMI PROJECT ****************************

WHAT IT IS

Petit Ami is a general purpose tool kit based on the libraries used in the
language Pascaline. The toolkit is written in the C language, but is written in
such a way as it does not have dependencies on the C language. Thus, it can be
used by several languages by the process of "binding" or using a cross language
API to interface to it.

Petit AMI addresses:

System services, such as directory listings, file name handling, paths,
    environment, other program execution, date and time, and
    internationalization.

Display drawing, windowing and graphics.

Sound processing.

Networking

Petit Ami is designed to supply a basic set of functionality commonly needed
by programs across multiple platforms.

The design basics of Petit Ami, and what makes it different from other,
similar toolkits is that Petit Ami is:

- The simplest possible set of functions needed to perform the covered functions.
  PA does not try to provide lots of ways to do things or give advanced features.
  It provides only the minimum necessary features, and leaves the makings of
  advanced libraries to other packages.

- PA uses the most simple I/O models possible. There are no callbacks, and there
  is a single event loop. If all the program needs is keyboard input, even the
  event loop can be bypassed.

- PA is upward compatible with the original text based models of programming
  languages. It uses standard C I/O like printf, scanf, putc, getc and other
  standard library functions, and builds on them in a compatable way. Thus any
  standard ANSI C program is automatically a Petit Ami compatible program. This
  is very different than virtually all existing TKs that force you to discard
  standard I/O models to use the GTK elements of their TK.
  
- It allows use of standard ANSI C and is language agnostic. PA came from
  another language, and is far less language dependent than supposedly "language
  independent" TKs. It does not depend on callbacks, void pointers, zero 
  terminated strings, classes/objects, and other language specific features. As
  with with a few other TKs, such language specific features are left to the
  individual language bindings.

WHAT IS PROVIDED

Petit Ami is a series of C files that address the various API sections that
make up the PA standard. The ability run standard ANSI library functions atop
a GUI is done by using replacing stdio and interdicting the basic file I/O calls,
including to the console.

PA can be run either native or stacked atop another TK. The first PA/TK
available is a layer of adaption code for GTK+, which allows PA/TK to run on
any system GTK+ can, including Windows, Linux an the MAC.

When another language besides C is used, an LTL or Language Translation layer
is included. Current LTLs are:

C++
Pascaline

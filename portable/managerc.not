                          NOTES FOR MANAGERC LIBRARY
                          
********************************************************************************

1. Its possible for the hover state to escape the root window. This would
happen if the hover window was clipped to an edge of the root window and the
mouse leaves from that clipped side, this would leave the hover enabled on that
window.

This is only a problem on windowed terminals, since a raw terminal won't be able
to go "outside the window". Thus, like the buffer following issue, it is only a
thing that occurs in a windowed system. Thus, like redraw, we can broadcast the
hover and nohover messages from the root window to the manager.

Xterm has a focus in/out escape code system for this. See:

https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#h2-Graphics

Unknown what Windows console mode can do.

2. Background color sets don't work.

3. Moving a window offscreen left puts it's cursor in an invalid location.

4. Buffer switching test fails on transparency test.

* The server side of remote display mode: the display, and the user, are      *
* here. The server links with the standard graphics package and runs          *
* standalone. The main thread runs the command loop: wait for a message of    *
* the remote display protocol (graph_remote.h, and the paper                  *
* doc/remote.pdf), execute it against the display library, and reply if the   *
* call returns values. A second thread runs the event pump: call event()      *
* forever and send each event out on the event channel the moment it is      *
* ready; events are pushed, never polled.                                     *
*                                                                              *
* The command port comes from GRAPH_PORT, GR_DEFPORT if unset; the event      *
* channel is the next port, and the file port the one after. The server      *
* holds the file cache in its current directory, filling it by the file      *
* transfer exchange: on a miss it names its file port in the request, and    *
* the client connects and streams the file in, close delimited.               *
*                                                                              *
* The server serves one client at a time, and when the client says bye it    *
* resets and cycles back to wait for the next connection, until the console   *
* interrupt cancels it. It must be started before its client.                 *
*                                                                              *

/*******************************************************************************

The display belongs to one thread

The pump thread owns the display: it is the only thread that calls into the
display library, whether to take an event or to make a call the client asked
for. The thread reading the wire owns nothing but the wire, and hands its work
across with ondisplay(), which posts the call and waits for it.

A window made, sized or freed under a thread that is drawing its frame is a
use after free whichever way the two threads interleave. One thread in the
library is what makes that impossible, rather than a guard around each call
that can meet it.

The post is by the event queue, which is locked and made for this, so a job
waiting cannot be missed: the wake either breaks the pump out of event() or is
already in the queue when it gets there.

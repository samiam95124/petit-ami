Mail: the part that does not draw

The mail program proper -- the store, the index, the digests, the
accounts, the reading of messages, the talking to servers, and the
thread that does all of it. None of it draws anything.

Two front ends put it on a screen: mail, which is graphical, and mailc,
which is characters. They share this file and differ in nothing else.
What each must supply, and the one rule they must both keep, is written
at the top of mailcore.h.

Digests

Every message gets a SHA-256 of the bytes it is stored as. It is what
lets this program know a message it already has, whoever sends it and
whatever folder it arrives in: mail moved between folders keeps its
digest, mail fetched twice has the same digest, and mail from a second
server that is the same mail has the same digest. UIDs cannot do any of
that -- they belong to one folder on one server and mean nothing
anywhere else.

The digest covers the message and not the separator line above it, since
that line is this program's own and carries a time that is not the
message's.

The digests of a folder are kept in a file beside its mailbox, one to a
line, with the size the mailbox had when they were taken on the first
line. A mailbox that has grown since is read again and the file rebuilt,
so the two cannot drift apart without being noticed.

The index file

One beside each mailbox, holding a line for every message in it: where
it is in the file and how long it is, what it is (its digest), who it is
from, what it is about, when it came and the start of what it says --
everything the list shows and everything the store is searched by.

It is written as it is filled, a line at a time, and read back at
startup. Reading it costs a few megabytes; working it out again from the
mailbox costs reading and parsing every byte of mail there is, which on
this store is five gigabytes and half a minute of somebody's attention.

The file needs no stamp saying how far it goes. The messages it names
say that themselves: the furthest of them ends where the indexed part of
the mailbox ends, and anything after that in the mailbox is new. A
mailbox that is shorter than that, or that does not have a separator
where the index says a message begins, has been rewritten under the
index, and the index is thrown away and taken again.

Fields are separated by tabs. Anything that could hold a tab or a line
end -- a subject, a snippet -- is written with those escaped, since a
record is a line and has to stay one.

categories can be changed, added to or thrown away without a compiler.

The rule that earns its keep is the last one. Machine-sent mail says so
in its headers: List-Unsubscribe, List-Id, Precedence: bulk. Mail with
none of those, having matched nothing more particular, was written by a
person -- which is the division that actually matters in a mailbox, and

Making a message readable

Mail is not text any more. It is nearly always MIME, often several
copies of the same message in different forms, and what is wanted is the

text one at all it takes the html and strips the tags, which is not
pretty but is better than showing the markup.

Keeping the indexes across a rebuild of the folder list

Asking the servers what folders they have builds the list again from
their answers, which throws away everything the old list held --
including every folder's index. Reading them all back means reading
every mailbox in the store, and losing them means the digests go with
them: a fetch straight after a Get Mail would find nothing already here
and store the whole store a second time. It did, once, and doubled a
test mailbox before the counts gave it away.

So the indexes are set aside before the list is taken again, and each
one is given back to whichever folder ends up with its mailbox. What no
folder claims is let go: its mailbox is not there any more.

Talking to the IMAP server

The protocol is lines. A command is given a tag, and everything the
server says back is either untagged, beginning with *, which is data, or
tagged with our tag, which is the answer and ends the command. What makes
it more than that is the literal: a length in braces at the end of a
line, followed by exactly that many bytes, which may be anything at all
including newlines. That is how a message arrives.

Two threads

The fetching is done on a thread of its own, and the display is left to
the main one. It has to be: a read from a server can take as long as the
server feels like taking, and while it did that on the display thread
the window did not repaint and the mouse did nothing. Timeouts bounded
that wait; they did not remove it.

The division is simple, and it is worth stating plainly because the
whole of the locking depends on it.

    The worker owns the network. It opens connections, reads messages,
    appends them to the mailboxes, writes the digests and the markers,
    and moves the folder counts up. It draws nothing and calls no
    graphics function at all.

    The main thread owns the display. Everything it does, it does while
    handling an event, and it looks at the worker's progress on a timer
    -- ten times a second, which is faster than the eye and slower than
    the flicker that redrawing per message would be.

One lock guards what they share: the folder table and the files under
the store. The main thread holds it for as long as it is handling an
event and drops it while it waits for the next one, so every click,
redraw and menu choice is already covered without a lock of its own.
The worker takes it around the commit of each message -- the append, the
digest, the count -- which is short, and around anything that rebuilds
the folder table.

Because the lock is not recursive, it is taken in exactly those two
places and nowhere else. No helper takes it, so no helper can be called
from a path that already holds it and deadlock.

Fetching, a message at a time

A fetch of a real mailbox is thousands of messages and takes as long as
it takes. Done in one loop it would hold the event loop shut for all of
that time, and a window that is not in its event loop is a window that
shows nothing: the library puts its drawing on the wire in ami_event and
nowhere else, so a progress line written from inside such a loop is
written to a screen that never repaints. The window would sit there,
frozen and blank, for hours.

So the fetch is a state machine, stepped by a timer. Each tick takes one
message and returns, which keeps the event loop turning: the count
appears as it climbs, the window redraws, the folders can be clicked
through while it runs, and it can be stopped.

Leaving a server alone after it stops answering

A server that has gone quiet is not helped by being asked again a
quarter of a minute later, and a server that has gone quiet because it
has had enough of us -- which is what tens of thousands of messages
earns from a large provider -- is made worse by it. So a failure puts
that account aside for a while, and the while doubles each time: a
quarter minute, then half, then a minute, up to a quarter of an hour.
Anything that arrives puts it back to nothing.

This is the whole of the retry policy, and it is deliberately not a loop
around the read. The fetch is already resumable -- every folder
remembers the stretch it has taken, and every message is known by its
digest -- so the next look IS the retry, and it costs nothing to let it
be the next scheduled one. A retry inside the fetch would only be the
same request sent sooner, to a server that has just declined to answer.

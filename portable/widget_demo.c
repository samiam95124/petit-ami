\brief WIDGET DEMONSTRATOR: HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN WIDGET

Copyright (C) 2026 Scott A. Franco

This is a demonstrator for creating your own widgets on top of Petit-Ami
graphics. It is the smallest possible widget package: exactly one widget,
built on widget_base.c, the common support shared with the stock widget
set in gnome_widgets.c, so the shape of the thing can be seen whole.

The widget here is a "kick button": a button whose face is a still photo
of a soccer player. Press it and the player kicks the ball, as a frame
animation with a kick sound at the moment of contact. That is all it
does. It is deliberately not useful; it is deliberately a widget no stock
widget set would ever give you, which is the point of rolling your own.

                            THE RECIPE

A widget is a small frameless subwindow of the window that owns it. That
one idea buys everything else: the graphics module clips it, buffers it,
occludes it and delivers events addressed to it, exactly as for any other
window. The base (widget_base.h) owns that machinery; what remains for
the widget author is exactly what makes the widget itself:

1. THE RECORD: declare your widget record with the base head first
   (WB_WIGHEAD) and your own state after it -- here, the animation frame
   and whether it is running. Register the package once at startup
   (wb_init), passing your callbacks.

2. DRAW: paint the face on the widget window when a redraw event arrives,
   and whenever your own state changes. The face here is a picture
   (ami_loadpict/ami_picture); the stock set draws with lines, rectangles
   and text. Anything the drawing calls can do can be a widget face.

3. BEHAVE: your dispatch callback receives every event addressed to your
   widgets' windows -- mouse, keyboard, timers, redraw -- and reports to
   the parent window's event queue with ami_sendevent. A widget standing
   in for a stock kind would report the stock code; a widget with no
   stock analogue defines its own code from the user space, ami_etuser
   and up, with the event record's union fields its own to assign. This
   widget defines ETKICKED (widget_demo.h), fired not at the press but
   at the frame where the foot meets the ball, the widget id riding in
   the record.

4. ENTRY CALLS: a widget package defines its own. The stock set overrides
   the ami_ widget vectors because it implements the standard set; a user
   widget has no vector to override, and none is needed: kickbutton() is
   just a call, and wb_widget/wb_killwidget under it do the mechanics.

The base holds what every package needs alike: the tracking tables, the
subwindow creation, the event chain intercept that routes each package
its own windows and passes the rest down, teardown, and the close()
override that takes a window's widgets down with it. Read this file for
the shape, then gnome_widgets.c for what a full set looks like on the
same base.

                              THE ASSETS

The animation frames (tests/widget_demo/kick01.bmp ...) are derived from
"Boykickingball-slowmotion-tokyo-20160423.webm" by Nesnad, from Wikimedia
Commons, licensed CC BY 4.0 (creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0). The
kick sound (tests/widget_demo/kick.wav) is synthesized for this demo and
carries no license restrictions. Pictures load only as 24 bit uncompressed
.bmp, which is why the frames are stored that way.

Kick button event handler

The widget's behavior, fed by the events the base routes to this package
for its widget windows:

- redraw paints the face.
- a button 1 press starts the kick: a repeating timer on the widget
  window paces the frames.
- each timer tick advances a frame; at the contact frame the kick sound
  fires and the kick reports to the parent as the user defined ETKICKED
  event -- the widget's meaning is "he kicked the ball", and that is
  when the ball is kicked; after the last frame the timer is killed and
  the face returns to the still.
- focus, hover and their ends just repaint, showing the state color.

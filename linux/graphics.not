             NOTES FOR GRAPHICS LIBRARY

1. Graphics needs a TrueType facillity like FreeType to give it a reasonable 
number of non-obsolete fonts.

2. Need pa_joybutton() and pa_joyaxis() calls to get the real limits from the
joystick ioctl interface.

3. Implement configuration parameters.

4. If a window is cancelled by the command bar method when it has finished, it
shows:

X connection to :0 broken (explicit kill or server shutdown).

5. Need to implement multitask locking broadly across the code.

6. Frame cancel on active window does not terminate.

7. Cannot handle mutually exclusive font capabilities, like bold only appearing
with condensed cannot match bold with normal.

8. Joystick events and frame timer events must go to either a window or all 
windows.

             NOTES FOR XTERM TERMINAL LIBRARY

1. A lot of white (xterm background) flash when resizing/winch.

MACOSX/Quartz version ============================================================

1. In the Mac OS X version, the final benchmark tallys are getting erased. I 
suspect this comes down to different treatment by xterms of the "restore normal
buffer" command in deinit().

2. INS key does not work in edit mode.

3. Forward and backward word to not work.

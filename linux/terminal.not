             NOTES FOR XTERM TERMINAL LIBRARY

1. In the program "play", hitting a number like "1" does not take effect until you
hit another digit.

2. The other terminal modules treat tabbing as per buffer, that is, each buffer
keeps track of separate tabbing drums. This is logical, since every other
characteristic tracks with the buffer.

             NOTES FOR XTERM TERMINAL LIBRARY

1. The other terminal modules treat tabbing as per buffer, that is, each buffer
keeps track of separate tabbing drums. This is logical, since every other
characteristic tracks with the buffer.

2. Still looks like we are not getting true white on the background.

3. In the Mac OS X version, the final benchmark tallys are getting erased. I 
suspect this comes down to different treatment by xterms of the "restore normal
buffer" command in deinit().

*                       TERMINAL SCREEN CAPTURE MODULE                         *
*                                                                              *
* Linux version, for the terminal model programs. The screen of a terminal    *
* program belongs to the terminal emulator, not to the program, and what the  *
* program knows of it is characters. So the capture is characters: at each    *
* capture the terminal is asked to print its screen, and the pages the        *
* terminal prints, one per capture and each ended by a form feed, are the     *
* listing the test is judged on. A pixel of difference between two terminals, *
* two fonts or two scales does not reach it.                                   *
*                                                                              *
* The request is the ANSI media copy sequence, CSI 0 i, print screen, which   *
* xterm answers by writing the text of the screen to its printer command.     *
* The first capture also sets DECPFF, CSI ? 18 h, so that the terminal        *
* follows every page with a form feed. The harness starts the xterm with the  *
* printer command appending to the listing file:                               *
*                                                                              *
*   xterm -xrm '*printerCommand: cat >> tests/terminal_test.lst'              *
*         -xrm '*printAttributes: 0' -xrm '*printerAutoClose: true'           *
*                                                                              *
* printAttributes 0 keeps the pages to plain text; printerAutoClose closes    *
* the printer after each page, so each page is a process of its own that      *
* exits when it has appended its page. A terminal that is not xterm ignores   *
* both sequences and prints nothing.                                           *
*                                                                              *
* The capture is off until screen_capture_name() names the listing: an        *
* interactive run in an xterm whose printer is the default, lpr, must not     *
* send its screens to a printer. The listing is the terminal's to write, at   *
* the command the harness gave it; what this module does with the name is     *
* watch the file. xterm does not wait for the printer process, so a page      *
* asked for while the last is still being appended can land ahead of it; the  *
* capture waits, after each request, until the page's form feed is in the     *
* file, and only then returns to the program. One page is ever in flight, the *
* pages arrive in order, and when the program ends every page is there.       *
*                                                                              *
* The sequences are written beneath the terminal module's write override.     *
* That module places every byte written to standard output into its screen    *
* buffer, and a control sequence sent through it would land there as text; a  *
* direct system call reaches the terminal alone. Standard output is flushed   *
* first, and the terminal module writes its own sequences as it goes, so the  *
* request follows everything the program has drawn.                           *
*                                                                              *

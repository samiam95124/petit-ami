# Ami !

**One program source, presented wherever you run it.** The same
"hello, world" -- the standard C program, unchanged -- on a command
line, on a terminal, and in a graphical window:

| Command line | Terminal | Graphical |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ![hello on the command line](doc/images/hello_cmdline.png) | ![hello on a terminal](doc/images/hello_console.png) | ![hello in a window](doc/images/hello_graphical.png) |

And the same idea carried to a full application. This is one mail
client -- one core holding the store, the fetch engine and the
protocols -- with front ends that differ only in how they draw. In
pixels; in character cells on a stock terminal, windows and widgets
managed by Ami's own character-mode window manager; and the character
front end linked against the graphical library, which speaks the whole
terminal API onto a window of its own:

**mail** -- the graphical front end:

![the mail client, graphical](doc/images/mail_graphical.png)

**mailc** -- the same mail in character cells, running in a plain
terminal, with menus, windows and widgets from the character-mode
window manager:

![the mail client on a terminal](doc/images/mail_terminal.png)

**mailcg** -- the character front end, unchanged, compiled against the
graphical library:

![the character mail client on a graphical window](doc/images/mail_charwin.png)

And the whole of it in motion. Breakout, run eight ways: in characters
and in pixels, on this machine, over ssh, over Ami's own remote display
protocol, over waypipe, and on Mac OS X and Windows -- the same program
each time.

Note that not all transports carry sound, so some of the demos in the video
do not carry sound. Note however that the Ami remote transport does carry
sound ! In fact it is the only transport out of Wayland, X11 and WayPipe that does.

The AMI tk is a toolkit based on the idea that carefully crafted display
paradigms can carry forward. Ami starts with the serial display paradigm
and carries that into a terminal oriented paradigm, then to a fully
graphical and windowed paradigm.

To fetch and build it (the tree carries submodules, so take them along):

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/samiam95124/amitk.git
    cd amitk
    . setpath
    ./configure
    make

The full procedure, including what to do when the glibc override does
not match your system, is in [INSTALL](INSTALL).

Please see the following documents to get started in Petit-Ami

    doc/petit_ami.docx  The "grand unified" document of what it is, how to
                        install it, etc.
    INSTALL             The basic install procedure.

The project is presented as complete within a single tree. The format is
along the lines of GNU projects, IE, with a configure, Makefile, README, etc.

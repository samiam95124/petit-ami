C++ wrapper notes

1. Can use references instead of passed pointers in parameters.

2. Research use of C++ string parameters instead of C strings.

3. Windows fails on streams, because (apparently) streams don't go through the 
standard libc package. Note that Linux does not have this issue.

4. Implement exceptions after PA general package implements that as well.

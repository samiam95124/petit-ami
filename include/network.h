* Implements access to Internet functions, via tcp/ip. tcp/ip is implemented   *
* via the "file" paradigm. An address and port is used to create a file, then  *
* normal C read and write statements are used to access it.                    *
*                                                                              *
* Also implement message or fixed length packet service for use in high        *
* performance computing and applications that need to determine their own      *
* reliable delivery protocols like audio and video data.                       *
*                                                                              *
* String output buffers are "critical": a result may occupy the entire        *
* buffer, in which case the terminating zero is left off. Results shorter     *
* than the buffer are zero terminated. C callers should use length limited    *
* reads of such buffers (see strnlen and similar).                            *
*                                                                              *

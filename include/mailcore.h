Mail: what both front ends share

The mail program is in two halves. mailcore.c is the program proper --
the store, the index, the digests, the accounts, the reading of
messages, the talking to servers, and the thread that does all of it --
and it draws nothing at all. A front end puts it on a screen: mail does
that in graphics, mailc in characters, and they differ in nothing else.

A front end must supply three things, since only it knows how to say
anything:

    status()    a line saying what is going on
    fail()      something went wrong and somebody should be told
    statprog()  how far into a piece of work we are

and it must keep one rule: hold the lock, dlock() to dunlock(), for as
long as it is handling an event. The core takes the same lock around
each message it commits and around anything that rebuilds the folder
table, and takes it nowhere else. That is what makes it safe for the
fetch thread to be writing the store while the display is drawing it,
and it is the whole of the arrangement -- there is no other locking to
think about, and nothing in a front end should ever take the lock again.

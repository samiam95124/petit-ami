* The wire protocol for remote display mode, shared by the two modules that    *
* implement it:                                                                *

*     graph_client  exposes the complete graphics.h API to the program. Each   *
*                   call composes a message and sends it; event() returns the  *
*                   next inbound event. The program runs where the client is.  *
*                                                                              *
*     graph_server  owns the display. It plugs into the standard graphics      *
*                   package, executes inbound call messages against it, and    *
*                   sends the events back out.                                 *
*                                                                              *
* The display, mouse, keyboard and joystick face the user on the server side,  *
* while the program logic runs on the client side, which is why the            *
* arrangement is sometimes considered "upside down" relative to the usual      *
* client/server naming.                                                        *
*                                                                              *
* CHANNELS                                                                     *

* The link is two message channels of network.h, on adjacent ports:            *
*                                                                              *
*     command channel (port p):    client -> server call messages, and         *
*                                  server -> client replies to queries.        *
*     event channel   (port p+1):  server -> client events, continuously.      *
*                                                                              *
* The server runs the command channel on its main thread: wait for a message,  *
* execute it against the display library, reply if the call returns values.    *
* A second thread runs the event channel: call event() forever and send each   *
* event out, as soon as it is ready. Events are pushed, never polled: a pull   *
* model would cost a round trip per event. The client mirrors the push with a  *
* receiver thread of its own, which moves inbound events to the client's       *
* queue as they arrive; event() takes from the queue, and the program          *
* regulates its consumption there. The queue is also where the anticipated     *
* optimization of collapsing redundant events belongs. Calls stay on the       *
* program's thread.                                                            *
*                                                                              *
* Queries are synchronous: the client sends the request and waits for the      *
* reply on the command channel before issuing anything else. There is thus     *
* at most one request outstanding, and replies cannot interleave. The seq      *
* field carries a serial number that the reply echoes, as a consistency        *
* check.                                                                       *
*                                                                              *
* WIRE FORMAT                                                                  *

* Every message is one message-channel datagram, and must fit the channel      *
* maximum given by maxmsg() for the address; senders chunk the write stream    *

* window file parameter excluded (it is the header wid).                       *
*                                                                              *

* The client assigns window handles: handle 1 is the main window (the          *
* standard input/output pair), and openwin() takes the parent handle, the      *
* new handle, and the logical window id. The server maps handles to its own    *
* window files. A window closes with GR_MCLOSEWIN.                             *
*                                                                              *
* SCOPE                                                                        *

* The mouse, the keyboard and the joysticks are the server's; their events     *
* flow to the client, and the input device queries are synchronous queries     *
* like any other. eventover(), eventsover() and sendevent() act on the         *
* client's own event stream and put nothing on the wire. Print files           *
* (openprint()) are reserved for a later protocol version.                     *
*                                                                              *
* FILE TRANSFER                                                                *
*                                                                              *
* Files named in calls, the picture files of loadpict(), live where the        *
* program lives, on the client; the server holds a cache, its current          *
* directory. When a call names a file the server looks it up: first the name   *
* as given, then the base name in the cache. If it holds the file the call     *
* proceeds. If not, it requests the file from the client, on the model of      *
* ftp's passive form: the request goes by message inside the pending call's    *
* reply window, naming the file and the server's file port, the command       *
* port + 2. The client opens that port as a stream connection (opennet())     *
* and streams the file in, raw bytes, close delimited; an empty stream is a   *
* file the client does not hold either. The received file is stored in the    *
* cache under its base name, never under a path the client supplied, and the  *
* call then proceeds against the cache and sends its reply.                    *
*                                                                              *
* The passive form is used because the message channels do not disclose the    *
* client's address to the server, while the client always knows the            *
* server's; it is also the form that crosses address translation toward the   *
* server. One transfer runs at a time, which the one outstanding request       *
* rule already guarantees. The mechanism is not tied to pictures: any call     *
* that names a file uses the same exchange.                                    *
*                                                                              *
* RELIABILITY                                                                  *
*                                                                              *
* The protocol requires a reliable channel, in the sense of relymsg():         *
* no loss, no reordering. The local machine connection of the standard test    *
* setup is reliable by definition. Operation over an unreliable network      *
* needs a retransmission layer under this protocol, which is future work.      *
*                                                                              *

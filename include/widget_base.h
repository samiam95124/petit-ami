\brief WIDGET PACKAGE BASE DEFINITIONS

The common support under widget packages built on Petit-Ami graphics: the
machinery that is the same no matter what the widgets are. A widget
package -- the stock set in gnome_widgets.c, the demonstrator in
widget_demo.c, or one of your own -- supplies its widgets: the record
fields they keep, the draw and event code that gives them their look and
behavior, and the entry calls that create them. The base supplies the
rest:

- the tracking model: a per window table of widgets by client id, the
  window id to widget map that routes events, and the record free list;
- creation: a widget is a frameless subwindow of its owner, and the base
  opens, places and registers it;
- the event intercept: the base hooks the event chain once and fields
  events for all packages' widget windows, handing each to its package's
  dispatch function and passing everything else down the chain;
- teardown: killing a widget, and taking a window's widgets down with it
  when the window file closes under them;
- anonymous (negative) widget id allocation.

A package declares one wbpkg, statically, and initializes it with
wb_init from its constructor, passing its callbacks. Packages coexist:
each catches only its own windows.

The package's widget record must begin with the base head, laid down by
the WB_WIGHEAD macro with the package's own record pointer type, so the
head fields read naturally (wg->wf, wg->id) and the base can work on any
package's records:

    typedef struct wigrec* wigptr;
    typedef struct wigrec {

        WB_WIGHEAD(wigptr)          -- the base head, first
        (the package's own fields)

    } wigrec;

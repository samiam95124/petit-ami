* Reads mail from an IMAP server and shows it, in the manner of the web mail   *
* readers: the folders down the left, the messages of the chosen folder on     *
* the right, one line each, with the sender, the subject, the start of the     *
* message and when it arrived.                                                 *
*                                                                              *
* Nothing on the server is changed. The folder is opened with EXAMINE, which   *
* the protocol defines as read only, and the message is asked for with         *
* BODY.PEEK[], which is the form that does not mark it read. Either alone      *
* would do; both are used because a mail reader that quietly marks a thousand  *
* messages read is a mail reader nobody will trust twice.                      *
*                                                                              *
* What comes off the server is written to a file as it arrived, headers and    *
* all, in mbox format: the message is not taken apart to be stored, only to    *
* be shown. Everything the reader displays it finds by searching that file     *
* again, so the file is the truth and the display is a view of it. A file      *
* that this program wrote can be read by any other mail program, and one       *
* written by another mail program can be read by this.                         *
*                                                                              *
* The mail is kept in a directory of its own, ~/.amimail by default, one       *
* .mbox file per folder and a small state file beside it recording how far     *
* the folder was read, so that fetching again fetches only what is new.        *
*                                                                              *

Writing a message

A window with the three fields a message needs and a body to type in.
The fields are edit boxes, which the library gives us; the body is not,
since there is no widget for more than one line of text, so it is kept
and drawn here.

The body is a list of lines and a place in one of them, which is the
model the editor in this kit uses and the simplest one that behaves the
way a person expects. Everything that types into it comes to the window
as an event: a click on an edit box takes the keys away, and a click on
the body gives them back, which is what the library does with focus and
what makes the two kinds of field live together.

That takes no machinery. There is one event queue for the program, and
every event names the window it came from, so the main loop tells the
help window's events from the mail's by their window id and hands them
here. Nothing is nested, and no thread is needed -- though one could be
put in charge of this window just as well, since its state is all here.

Widgets are numbered within their window, so the search entry, the topic
list and the close button are 1, 2 and 3 here even though the mail's
scroll bars are 1 and 2 there.

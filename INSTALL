Installing Petit-ami

Installation of Petit-ami really just consists of unpacking the
library an executing:

. setpath

To set up the binaries for execution.

To ease having to install all the packages Petit-ami
relies on, I have created the bin/install script. It does a
package install of all the libraries Petit-ami uses.

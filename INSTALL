Installing Petit-ami

First of all, remember that petit-ami is in development. This means that 
everything may not work perfectly.

Steps to install

1. execute:

$ . setpath

To set up the binaries for execution.

2. Perform the install script. This makes sure you have the required packages:

$ install

3. Set the version of libc override you have:

$ setver_glibc

If you get something like:

$ setver_glibc
Version number: 2.31
*** libc override file by version 2.31 does not exist

Then you have to build a new version of glibc. There are a collection of
previous and current versions that correspond to the OS builds encountered.
If a prebuilt version does not exist, you simply have to make it.

This is done with the script:

$ build_glibc

When this completes with no error, you can then execute:

$ setver_glibc

If this gives errors, it means the current glibc has changed enough that it no
longer can just be automatically patched to find the new version. In this case,
you will need to get an updated petit_ami or do some serious debug work.

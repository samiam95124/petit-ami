Get message certificate

Fetches the SSL certificate for an DTLS connection. The file must contain
an open and active DTLS connection. Retrieves on of the indicated
certificates by number, from 1 to N where N is the maximum certificate in the
chain. Certificate 1 is the certificate for the server connected. Certificate
N is the CA or Certificate Authority's certificate, AKA the root certificate.
The size of the certificate buffer is passed, and the actual length of the
certificate is returned. If there is no certificate by a given number, the
resulting length is zero.

Certificates are in base64 format, the same as a PEM file, starting with the
line "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and ending with the line
"-----END CERTIFICATE----". The buffer contains a whole
certificate. Note that characters with value < 20 (control characters), may or
may not be included in the certificate. Typically carriage returns, line feed
or both may be used to break up lines in the certificate.

Certificates are normally retrieved in numerical order, that is, 1, 2, 3...N.
Thus the end of the certificate chain must be found by traversal.

The certificate buffer is a critical buffer: a result that fills the entire
buffer is left without a terminating zero, a shorter result is zero
terminated, and it is an error if the certificate cannot fit in the buffer.

Note that this routine retrieves the peer certificate, or other end of the
line. Servers are required to provide certificates. Clients are not.
